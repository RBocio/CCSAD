            Reading Club 2000 was founded by Nanie Guanlao in 2000 as a simple initiative to share his personal collection of books with his community. Starting from his home in Makati City, the club has grown into a beloved community hub where people can freely borrow and donate books. Nanie’s belief that "a book should be used and reused" remains the cornerstone of the club’s philosophy. Over the years, Reading Club 2000 has inspired similar initiatives worldwide, advocating for a sustainable and inclusive approach to reading and learning.
